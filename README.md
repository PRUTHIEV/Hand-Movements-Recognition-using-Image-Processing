# Hand-Movements-Recognition-using-Image-Processing

This paper presents a real time model for students with hearing and speaking disabilities. 
Around 12 lakh students are affected with speaking and hearing disabilities in India, among which 47% female , 53% male with hearing disabliity and 44% Female, 56% male with speaking disability. 
These Students face difficulties in understanding and expressing their feelings and thoughts. 
Communicating with hand gestures require prior knowledge and sometimes may lead to miscommunication. 
This paper helps the students in their education in such a way that it converts the hand gestures using Deep Learning and Image Processing techniques. 
We will develop a Model / Application for these students to build their self confidence and increase the national literacy rate. 
The datasets are hand movement videos that are captured frame by frame collected by our own effort for both training and validation. 
The LSTM(Long Term Short Memory) Deep Learning Model is developed to detect a series of hand movements and convert them to text and speech.
Image Processing is used to extract the key points on hands to configure their hand movements.
